❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a+b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function scope, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior.
* ❌ The function does not accept any arguments, making it inflexible and limited to using global variables (which is bad
practice).

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ The function now accepts `a` and `b` as parameters, making it reusable with different inputs.
* ✔ The variables are scoped within the function, avoiding potential conflicts with global variables.

Additional Notes:

* Consider adding input validation to ensure that `a` and `b` are numbers to avoid unexpected results.
* You can also add a default value to the parameters in the function if you want to provide default values.
